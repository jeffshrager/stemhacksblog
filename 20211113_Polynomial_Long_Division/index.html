  <title>Algebraic Expressions Really Are Numbers! (Or is it the other way around?)</title>
  <h2>Algebraic Expressions Really Are Numbers! (Or is it the other way around?)</h2>
<p></p>

  <p>So, you know when they write something like $x+4=7$, and you go ...</p>

  <p>Yeah, $x$ is $2$. Easy. So what?</p>

  <p>Well, d'you ever think to read these equations like someone is
  stating a fact? Like "California is west of Pennsylvania."</p>

  <p>I don't really follow you.</p>

  <p>I mean, when, let's say that I said it out, like: "$X$ is a number, and $x+4$ is a different number that's 4 more than $x$, and that different number, $x+4$, is $7$, not just equal to $7$, but really is the number $7$."</p>

  <p>Now I'm <em>really</em> not following you! What do you mean that
  "$x+4$ is not just equal to $7$, but really is $7$"? They sound the
  same to me.</p>

  <p>Yeah, but it's not, really. I mean, if I say that someone looks
    like you and acts like you, and has your name, that's possible right?</p>

  <p>Unlikely, but possible, I guess. Like a clone or something?</p>

  <p>Right, maybe your twin. But they aren't you, right?</p>

  <p>Sure, obviously.</p>

  <p>Well, numbers don't have clones like that. Seven is just
  seven. Every expression that refers to seven, when I write it out in
  letters S-E-V-E-N, or write the number, $7$, or write it like $3+4$,
  they are all exactly the same thing -- the number that's one more
  than $6$ and one less than $8$.</p>

  <p>Where are you going with this?</p>

  <p>Okay, so when I say $x+4=6$, and if there's only one thing that
  is $6$, then when I say that $x+4=6$ I'm saying that the expression
  $x+4$ is just another way of writing $6$. Just like writing it out
  in letters S-I-X, and so on."</p>

  <p>You've really totally lost me.</p>

  <p>Okay, let's talk about something else.</p>
  
  <p>Good idea!</p>

  <p>You remember long division?</p>

  <p>Sure. It's been a while, but I think I can manage it.</p>

  <p>Great, so first multiply $43$ by $62$.</p>

  <p>You want me to use long multiplication?</p>
 
  <p>A calculator is fine, if you need it.</p>

  <p>$2666$</p>

  <p>Great, so now divide 2666 by $43$.</p>

  <p>Um, $62$? Is this a trick question?</p>

  <p>No, I mean divide it using log division.</p>

  <p>Oh, okay. I think I can manage that.</p>

$$
\require{enclose}
\begin{array}{rll}
    62 && \hbox{(Explanations)} \\[-3pt]
   43 \enclose{longdiv}{2666}\kern-.2ex \\[-3pt]
      \underline{258\phantom{0}} && \hbox{($43 \times 6 = 258$)} \\[-3pt]
      8\phantom{0} && \hbox{($266 - 258 = 8 $)} \\[-3pt]
      {\phantom{0}86} && \hbox{(Bring down the $6$)} \\[-3pt]
      \phantom{0}\underline{86} && \hbox{($43 \times 2 = 86$)} \\[-3pt]
      {\phantom{00}0} && \hbox{($86 - 86 = 0$)} \\[-3pt]
      \phantom{00}Done!
  \end{array}
$$

  <p>See: $62$!</p>

  <p>Great. So now do this for me: $(4x+3)\times(6x+2)$.</p>

  <p>You mean just FOIL it? Um ... $24x^2+18x+8x+6$ so, uh ... $24x^2+26x+6$ </p>

  <p>Excellent, so Great. So what's $24x^2+26x+6$ divided by $(4x+3)$?</p>

  <p>Wait; What?! I don't know how to do that!</p>

  <p>Sure you do. You just multiplied them up there, so just undo the multiplication!</p>

  <p>Oh. I see. Sure, um I guess it's $(6x+2)$, right?</p>

  <p>Exactly! But, now to it by long dibision!</p>

  <p>Hunh? Now I have no idea what you're talking about.</p>

  <p>No, really. It works exactly like long divison of numbers! Here, I'll show you:<p>

$$
\require{enclose}
\begin{array}{rll}
   (4x+3)  \enclose{longdiv}{24x^2+26x+6}\kern-.2ex \\[-3pt]
  \end{array}
$$

<p>I have no idea what to do with that!</p>

<p>Just do what you usually do. Ask what you have to multiply $(4x+3)$
by in order to be able to subtract it out from the head of $24x^2+26x+6$</p>

<p>Um, $6$?</p>

<p>That would make $24x+18$, but it looks like you need an $x^2$...</p>

<p>$6x$ then? That would make it $(24x^2+18x)$, but the 18 doesn't match up.</p>

<p>No worries. Let's do exactly what we would do in a long division:
Put $(24x^2+18x)$ under the head of the long experssion, and write the
$6x$ where it would normally go, over the end of the subexpression,
like this:</p>

$$
\require{enclose}
\begin{array}{rll}
    {6x\phantom{0@0}} && \\[-3pt]
   (4x+3)  \enclose{longdiv}{24x^2+26x+6}\kern-.2ex \\[-3pt]
      24x^2+18x\phantom{00@} && \\[-3pt]
  \end{array}
$$

<p>Okay, now we just subtract in the normal way we would in long division:</p>

$$
\require{enclose}
\begin{array}{rll}
    {6x\phantom{0@0}} && \\[-3pt]
   (4x+3)  \enclose{longdiv}{24x^2+26x+6}\kern-.2ex \\[-3pt]
      \underline{24x^2+18x}\phantom{00@} && \\[-3pt]
      8x\phantom{00@} && \\[-3pt]
  \end{array}
$$

<p>Now we'll bring down the next term, $+6$, in the normal way:</p>

$$
\require{enclose}
\begin{array}{rll}
    {6x\phantom{0@0}} && \\[-3pt]
   (4x+3)  \enclose{longdiv}{24x^2+26x+6}\kern-.2ex \\[-3pt]
      \underline{24x^2+18x}\phantom{00@} && \\[-3pt]
      8x+6 && \\[-3pt]
  \end{array}
$$

<p>Oh oh! I see, and $4x+3$ times $2$ is $8x+6$, and we put the $+2$ on top, at the end!</p>

$$
\require{enclose}
\begin{array}{rll}
    {6x+2} && \\[-3pt]
   (4x+3)  \enclose{longdiv}{24x^2+26x+6}\kern-.2ex \\[-3pt]
      \underline{24x^2+18x}\phantom{00@} && \\[-3pt]
      8x+6 && \\[-3pt]
      \underline{8x+6} && \\[-3pt]
      {\phantom{00}0} && \\[-3pt]
      \phantom{00}Done!
  \end{array}
