  <h2>StemHacks: Lisp: Language of The Gods</h2>
<p><hr></p>

  <p>
    To the extent that Love has any reality -- I mean True Love, not lust
or infatuation, but The One True Love of One's Life -- My OTL is Lisp.
Okay, so it's a bit ... weird? ... to be in love with a programming
language, but I've spent almost literally every day with Lisp since I
was around 17, so over 45 years now, and we've never had anything but
    a wonderful time together. If that's not True Love, what is?!
  </p>

  <p>
    And after all these years, I'm still being surprised by the wonders
that Lisp is capable of. Here I'll relate just one recent terrific
    experince Lisp and I had together.
  </p>

  <p>

    One of the many wonderful facts of Lisp is that many functions
    that in lesser languages are given what they think of as "concise"
    function names, are often written out in full, or at least
    legibly, in lisp. This isn't always the case; there is a nod here
    and there to "standard" notation. For example, "+" indicates
    addition and "-" subtraction, as in the standard math usages, and
    as in standard computer usage, "*" mean multiplication. (Actually,
    in the earliest lisps these were "ADD", etc.) But many other
    functions are written out, or given pronouncable
    abbreviations. For example, "COUNT", "AREF" (for array reference),
    and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some lesser-minded programmers think of this as merely annoying
    verbosity; requiring more keystrokes than absolutely required is
    anathema to some. Their loss! The great thing about pronouceable
    function names is that you can read your code more-or-less as if
    it was a natural language spec of the algoritm. It's sort of the
    half-way point between COBOL, which was way too vebose, and APL,
    which was gibberish. Algol-like languages such as C and its
    progeny take a different middle-road stance on this than
    Lisp. Perhaps because I was captured by Lisp early (although I did
    know Fortran, BASIC, and IBM assembler before learning Lisp), I
    prefer Lisp's choices in this space.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the most part, anyway! There is one critical choice of name
    that Lisp made wrongly, in my humble opinion, that is of the
    function-construtors: FUNCTION (abbreviated #'...) and
    LAMBDA. These create functions, and in practice are used where you
    need an ananymous function, for example: <\p>

    <pre><code>
      (mapcar #'(lambda (a b c) (+ c (* a b))) '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6) '(7 8 9))
      => (11 18 27)
      ;;; Or equivalently:
      (mapcar (function (lambda (a b c) (+ c (* a b)))) '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6) '(7 8 9))
      (mapcar (lambda (a b c) (+ c (* a b))) '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6) '(7 8 9))
      ;;; But this is wrong!
      (mapcar (function (a b c) (+ c (* a b))) '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6) '(7 8 9))
      </code></pre>

    <p>
      The detailed relationship between these is a bit complex, and
      different Lisp programmers have different habits with them. I
      tend to use the first form above, but I've had different
      opinions from different Lisp programmers as to which is correct
      or redundant. But beacuse of the availability of the
      #'... abbreviation, no one ever writes out FUNCTION, even though
      it's implied when you write #'...
      </p>

    <p>
      The LAMBDA is definitely not irrelevant! It wraps the the
      arguments, (a b c) in the above, into the body (+ ...), and then
      FUNCTION (or #'...) turns that package into a function. Note
      that the form without the LAMBDA is incorrect: FUNCTION only
      expects a single argument. You can, for example, name a function
      by using its symbol. For example in the following you don't need
      to LAMBDA because + is already a function; FUNCTION just gets
      the function object linked to the + symbol, whereas the LAMBDAs
      in the above examples <em>create a new function</em>.
      </p>

    <pre><code>
      (mapcar #'+ '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))
      => (5 7 9)
      ;;; Or equivalently:
      (mapcar (function +) '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))
      </code></pre>

    <p>
      But regardless of whether you write #'(LAMBDA ...) or leave out
      the #'..., when anonymous functions are being employed, the word
      LAMBDA is in the way of fluent reading.
      </p>

    <p>
      For years I've wanted something that would make anonymous
      functions, like the example above, more fluent. (It turns out
      that, after I wrote this whole thing, I discovered that others
      have had this problem as well, and some have famously fixed it
      in what turns out to be a very similar way as my solution, for
      example, Rich Hickey in Clojure.)
